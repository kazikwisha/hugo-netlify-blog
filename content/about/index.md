This serves as an online backup of my diary notes as far as software quality assurance work is concerned.

It doesn't necessary have to do with just technical skills but can have posts that I deem quite useful and I feel the need to share.

This is kind of a living documentation, so many posts here will be kept on a constant update mode as I curate and improve their quality.
