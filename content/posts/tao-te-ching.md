```
Stop thinking, and end your problems. 
What is difference between yes and no? 
What is the difference between success and failure?
Must you value what others value,
avoid what others avoid? 
How ridiculous!

Other people are excited 
as though they were at a parade 
I alone don't care 
I alone am expressionless 
like an infant before it can smile.

Other people have what they need; 
I alone possess nothing 
I alone drift about 
like someone without a home
I am like an idiot, my mind is so empty.


Other people are bright
I alone am dark 
Other people are sharp;
I alone am dull,
Other people have a purpose
I alone don't know 
I drift like a wave on the ocean
I bow as aimless as the wind.

I am different from ordinary people
I drink from the Great Mother's breasts.

Lao Tzu (China)
