```
When I grab that brush 
I lose control of the world around me;
with a clear uninterrupted mind 
I go on a spiritual journey. 

I merge into the subconscious 
In pursuit of self realisation 
I reach the vanguard of that divine orgasm that triggers my creative hormones.

Through the priceless bristles of sable 
pour pure hues of paint
Onto an innocent virgin white canvas.

Creating a whole new spectrum 
A new disciple of colours 
that smell like the sweet fragrance of a jack fruit 
and shout out aloud. 

Like the buzzing of warriors 
washing from the successful encounter that profound ego to create 
Emanating from the very essence of my existence reincarnates another hidden soul
through that brush! 

Samson Ssenkaaba(Uganda)
